The project is a water strider simulator that shows whether the offspring can successfully float on the water surface based on genetic algorithms. 

There are 3 attributes influence on the result, which are the weight of the body, the length of legs and the amount of bristles on legs. 
And the genotype of the water strider contains three characters according to these attributes.

The first character of genotype decides the weight of the body. The associated phenotype is the detail of the body. 
It is random selected from 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'. The water strider with 'a' has lighter and less detailed body while with 'f' has heavier and more detailed bodybody. 
 

The second character of genotype decides the length of legs. The associated phenotype is the length of legs. 
It is random selected from 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l'. The water strider with 'l' has longer legs while with 'g' has shoter legs.


The third character of genotype decides the amount of bristles on legs. The associated phenotype is the color of the water strider. 
It is random selected from 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r'. The water strider with 'm' has a red color and got more bristles while with 'g' has a purple color and got fewer bristles.
